Coffee bean library is a dynamic parser from graphQL queries into SQL queries; this library example is using:

- Dapper
- Hot Chocolate
- Automapper
- Entity Framework
- PostgreSQL

## Current Features

- Allows business logic within the graphQL api project
- Data annotation based configuration (Data models and Entity models)
- Leverage automapper for mapping between Data models and Entity models
- Leverage generics to automatically generate the column names based on the ef core data entities
- Nodes (Left joins between entities)
- Edges (Joins between entities)
- Manages mutations for any generic objects
- Paging
- Filtering
- Sorting * Currently sorting has a limitation on advance sorting due to missing out of the box Hot Chocolate implementation


## Future Features

- Granular access by table/columns based on token-claims
- Add support to other database providers
- Query cache
